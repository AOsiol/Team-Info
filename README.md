# Team Info

The user story is where a project manager is assembling a team and needs to keep track of who is on the team. The project manager requests an app that can produce ID style placards for each member that can be viewed in the browser. The information entered for each team member will be conducted through the command line interface.

## Getting Started

The user will have to copy the file "team-info" and open it in a code editor such as Visual Studio Code and have to download npm packages including inquirer. Interaction with the app is done through node on the command line. Once started, the user will answer the questions about the employees as they are prompted.

## Tests

The functions in this app were tested during production using the tdd method as well as running the program as a whole to look for bugs and inconsistencies.
